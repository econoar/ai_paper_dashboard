  <h1>About This Dashboard</h1>
  <p>
    This dashboard is designed to help you quickly ingest and review the latest research papers in artificial intelligence.
    We query arXiv for papers in the broad categories of <strong>cs.AI, cs.LG, and stat.ML</strong>—areas focused on AI and machine learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, we apply a secondary filter by scanning the paper titles and abstracts for your specified keywords,
    such as "reinforcement learning," "digital twin," "agent coordination," and others.
    If none of these keywords are found, the Tags column displays "N/A"—this does not mean the paper isn’t relevant,
    but simply that it did not contain those exact terms.
  </p>
  <h2>Explore Relevant arXiv Categories</h2>
  <p>
    You can also visit these arXiv pages to see all recent papers in each category:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent" target="_blank">cs.AI – Artificial Intelligence</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent" target="_blank">cs.LG – Machine Learning</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent" target="_blank">stat.ML – Statistical Machine Learning</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This two-tier filtering ensures that the papers you see are from the appropriate academic categories and
    also contain key topics that you care about.
    If you have any questions or feedback about the filtering process, please feel free to contact us.
